What did you like about this project?
What I like about this project is we try to apply everything we had learnt. To be honest, I expected a very different assessement than this.


What did you struggle with in this project?
The thing that I mostly struggled with is making my Bitcoin appear on the field. No matter how hard I tried, it wouldn't appear. I still need to revise the code accordingly.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Nothing. I love the challenge. However it would be better if there are some helpful tips and tricks that can be "sprinkled". Hahah
